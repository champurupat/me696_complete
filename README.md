make sure waffle and gazebo model path is exported in your .bashrc

# Sample Workflow
```
cd
mkdir me696_hh2_ws
cd me696_hh2_ws
git clone git@github.com:champurupat/me696_complete.git # using ssh here, swap for https url if necessary
mv me696_complete src # rename github repo to src
colcon build
```
# Just Gazebo World
to launch gazebo of holmes hall second floor fresh terminal, be in the me696_hh2_ws directory
```
cd
cd me696_hh2_ws
. install/setup.bash
ros2 launch holmes_nav holmes_hall.launch.py
```
# Wall Following Demo
to launch wall follower run the following commands in different terminals in this order:
```
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py use_sim_time:=True autostart:=False # for nav2 navigation suite

ros2 launch holmes_nav holmes_hall.launch.py # spawn tb3 in hh2

ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py # to launch slam too

ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d $(ros2 pkg prefix nav2_bringup)/share/nav2_bringup/rviz/nav2_default_view.rviz # to bring up rviz gui

ros2 run autonomy state_estimator_node 

ros2 run autonomy autonomy_node 
```
then send a goal pose msg, in this example can change x and y coordinates:
```
ros2 topic pub -1 /goal geometry_msgs/msg/Pose '{position: {x: 0.0, y: -10.0, z: 0.0}, orientation: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0, w: 1.0}}'
```
# SLAM Toolbox RVIZ Plugin Usage
to continue SLAM on a previously saved <map name>.posegraph/<map name.data pair:
1. In RVIZ toolbar `Panels>>Add New Panel>>SlamToolboxPlugin`
2. In the `"Deserialize Map"` textbox enter the absolute path to where the <map name>.pose_graph/<map name>.data pair is located but only address map with <map name>
  - for example, `pwd` in the `me696complete/sample_maps/sample_maps` of this repository on your local machine and enter into textbox `.../sample_maps/sample_maps/wide`
  
to save a SLAM map generated by slam_toolbox so it can be continued later:
1. In RVIZ toolbar `Panels>>Add New Panel>>SlamToolboxPlugin`
2. In the `"Serialize Map"` textbox enter the `absolute/path/<map name>` where you'd like to save the map, indicate only the desired <map name> no file extension

Note: `"Save Map"` also requires an absolute path to desired save location but will generate a .pgm/.yaml map and **exit out of RVIZ automatically**. Be sure to save .posegraph/.data if intended before saving .pgm/.yaml!
# Other
To call serialized map immediately during slam_toolbox launch:
```
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py use_sim_time:=True params_file:="$(ros2 pkg prefix sample_maps)/share/sample_maps/sample_maps/params_config.yaml"
```
however, the `me696complete/sample_maps/sample_maps/param_config.yaml` file on the local machine must be edited to have `slam_toolbox-ros__parameters-map_file_name: absolute/path/<map name>`,  environment shortcuts like `$(ros2 pkg prefix sample_maps)` as it currently is in the params_config.yaml will not work at runtime, absolute paths to the file on the local machine are necessary
